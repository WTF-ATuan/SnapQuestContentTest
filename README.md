# SnapQuest Content Test â€“ Level Submission by Benson

This submission includes three puzzle levels, each designed to progressively introduce and reinforce the game's core mechanics. Players learn by doing â€” each level builds on the last, adding new elements while ensuring the logic remains clear and understandable.

If given more time, I would continue layering these mechanics to create more complex puzzles while maintaining clarity. I believe strong puzzle design is a dialogue between the player and the game, and each level should teach, challenge, and reward in balance.
